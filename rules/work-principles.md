# Work Principles

## MANDATORY: Task Discipline

- Create tasks (TaskCreate) before starting any non-trivial work.
- Mark tasks `in_progress` immediately before starting work on them.
- Mark tasks `completed` immediately after finishing — no batching, no delay.
- If a task reveals subtasks, create them right away.

## Momentum

The boulder never stops. Continue until all tasks complete.
